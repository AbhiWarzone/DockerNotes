There was a organization called as dot cloud who were working on same PAAS application, to test this application they have created docker.
Docker was made opensource and there was lot of community intrest in Docker and then became orgnization’s major product.
The organization was renamed as Docker Inc
Application Deployment Options
------------------------------
   * We can deploy our application on
   * Physical Server
   * Virtual Machine
   * Containers
By experimenting we have understood, Container has everything which makes applications believe that they are running in OS

Containers
----------
 For long time, big web-scale organizations like Google have been using container technologies to overcome the shortcomings of VM Model.
 Containers on the single host share the host OS
 
The Docker Technology (HOW Docker Works Internally)
---------------------**------------------------------
There are three things to be aware of when we are referring to docker as a technology
 * The runtime
 * The daemon/Engine
 * The orchestrator
 Refer here -- https://i0.wp.com/directdevops.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/docker6.png?w=800&ssl=1
 * To interact with docker we have the docker client
 * Workflow of Container Creation
 Refer here -- https://i0.wp.com/directdevops.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/docker7.png?w=800&ssl=1
 * When the user executes the command to create container 'docker container run -d -P httpd' on the newly installed docker host
 * docker client forwards the request to docker daemon
 * docker daemon checks for the presence of images in the local repository. In this case the local images didn’t have the image httpd
 * Docker forwards the request to the configured registry. The default registry that is configred is docker hub (official website). 
   The image is searched in the configured registry and if not found error is shown to the user.
 * If the image is found then it is downloaded from docker registry to local images repository
 * Using the docker image the container is created (resources will be allocated)
 * Now lets see what happens the user executed the command 'docker container run -d -P httpd' again
 * docker client forwards the request to docker daemon
 * docker daemon checks for the presence of image httpd in local registry & since it is already downloaded in the 4 step above.
 * docker daemon creates a container with the existing image.
