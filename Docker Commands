Now to work with docker you can use the terminal
Initially running docker needs commands
  * use â€“help
  * Use any cheatsheet from the web

Install Docker on Linux
-----------------------
We need an linux instance. We will be create a linux instance in
Refer here -- AWS Cloud 
Ubuntu:
------
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker <username> #$USER
exit
# relogin
Type 'docker -v'
Type 'docker info'

Docker Image and Container Creation Basics
------------------------------------------
Lets see the list of the images in the newly installed docker
'docker image ls'
Downloading the image from registry is called as pull
The image name has two components <name-of-image>:<tag>
name of the image represents application
tag represents the version
If you dont pass the tag, docker will consider tag as latest so
If you have written image name as httpd == 'httpd:latest'
Now lets pull the 'jenkins/jenkins' image -----    'docker image pull jenkins/jenkins'
Lets create a jenkins container 'docker container run -d <image>:<tag>'
'docker container run -d jenkins/jenkins'
'docker container ls'
To access the application inside the docker we have to do port forwarding 'docker container run -d -p <hostport>:<containerport> <imageid>:<tag>'
